# Use MSI to authenticate simply from inside a VM

This sample explains how to use the SDK from inside an Azure resource like a VM, 
using Managed Service Identity (MSI) authentication. This sample covers the two types of MSI scenarios:

- System Assigned Identity: the identity is created by ARM on VM creation
- User Assigned Identity: the identity is created and managed by the user, and assigned during VM creation

<a id="run"></a>
## Run this sample

1. This sample is intended to be executed from inside a VM with MSI enabled. This document explains how to [create a VM with MSI enabled](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/compute-python-msi-vm).

1. If you don't already have it, [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on that VM.

1. We recommend to use a [virtual environnement](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to run this example, but it's not mandatory. You can initialize a virtualenv this way:

    ```
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv mytestenv
    cd mytestenv
    source bin/activate
    ```

1. Clone the repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/resource-manager-python-manage-resources-with-msi.git
    ```

1. Install the dependencies using pip.

    ```
    cd resource-manager-python-manage-resources-with-msi
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Run the sample.

    ```
    python example.py
    ```

<a id="example"></a>
## What is example.py doing?

The sample creates a MSI Authentication credentials class. Then it uses this credentials to
extract the current subscription ID. Finally it uses this credentials and subscription ID
to list all the available Resource Groups.

Note that listing Resource Group is just an example, there is no actual limit of what you can do with this 
credentials (creating a KeyVault account, managing the Network of your VMs, etc.). The limit
will be defined by the roles and policy assigned to the MSI token at the time of the creation of the VM.

### Create a System Assigned MSI authentication instance

Creating a `MSIAuthentication` instance using a System Assigned Identity does not require any parameter.

```python
from msrestazure.azure_active_directory import MSIAuthentication

credentials = MSIAuthentication()
```

<a id="create-credentials-user"></a>
### Create a User Assigned MSI authentication instance

You need to provide a reference to your User Assigned object in order to create an instance. There is possibilities:

- client_id: You can find this information on the portal under AD, in the App created for the User Assigned MSI.
- object_id: You can find this information on the portal under AD, in the App created for the User Assigned MSI.
- msi_res_id: The ARM resource id. Must conform to: `/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/rg/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/msiname`

```python
from msrestazure.azure_active_directory import MSIAuthentication

credentials = MSIAuthentication(
    client_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
)
```

or

```python
from msrestazure.azure_active_directory import MSIAuthentication

credentials = MSIAuthentication(
    object_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'
)
```

or

```python
from msrestazure.azure_active_directory import MSIAuthentication

credentials = MSIAuthentication(
    msi_res_id = '/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/rg/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/msiname'
)
```

<a id="subscription_id"></a>
### Get the subscription ID of that token

```python
from azure.mgmt.resource import SubscriptionClient

subscription_client = SubscriptionClient(credentials)
subscription = next(subscription_client.subscriptions.list())
subscription_id = subscription.subscription_id
```

<a id="list-groups"></a>
### List resource groups

List the resource groups in your subscription.

```python
from azure.mgmt.resource import ResourceManagementClient

resource_client = ResourceManagementClient(credentials, subscription_id)
for item in resource_client.resource_groups.list():
    print(resource_group.name)
```
